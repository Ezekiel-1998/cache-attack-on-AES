# cache-attack-on-AES
I implemented 4 methods for AES cache attack with complexities decrease dramatically.

method 1
keyrecov1.cpp
keyrecov_full.cpp

method 2
last_round_x86.cpp

method 3
last_round_all_line_x86_plot.cpp

method 4
last_round_all_b.cpp

auxiliary files
sample_all_lines.cpp is for demonstrate the significance with the sample size with method 3
sample_plot.gnu is for figure plot of the significance with the sample size
key_byte.gnu is for figure plot of the significance for each byte during keyrecovery
